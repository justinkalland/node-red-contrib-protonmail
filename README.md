# node-red-contrib-protonmail
[Node-RED node](https://nodered.org/) to send encrypted email through ProtonMail.

The goal of this project is to replicate the functionality of [node-red-node-email](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-email) but using a [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) account.
